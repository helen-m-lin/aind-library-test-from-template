# Example workflow to use the reusable publish workflow
# This workflow is triggered by a push to a tag that matches the pattern 'v[0-9]*'
# (indicating a semantic versioning tag) or manually via workflow_dispatch.
# It creates a release and uploads the package to PyPI.
# * The concurrency group ensures that only one release job runs at a time.
# * This workflow should be placed in `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
# of your repository.
# * The workflow uses a service token for authentication to PyPI.
